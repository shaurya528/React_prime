# Artwork Gallery

This is a simple React app that shows a list of artworks in a table.

## What it does

- Gets artwork data from the Art Institute of Chicago API
- Shows artwork images, titles, artists, and more in a paginated table
- Lets you select multiple artworks and clear selections
- Uses PrimeReact for UI components

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:


2. Start the app:


3. Open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

## Files

- `App.tsx` – main layout
- `ArtworkTable.tsx` – artwork table with selection and pagination
- `SelectionPanel.tsx` – shows selected artworks
- `api.ts` – API calls
- `index.ts` – TypeScript types
- `main.tsx`, `index.css`, `App.css` – setup and styles

## Notes

I practiced working with React, TypeScript, and API requests.  
There are some TODO and `console.log` lines for debugging and learning.  
Open for suggestions!
